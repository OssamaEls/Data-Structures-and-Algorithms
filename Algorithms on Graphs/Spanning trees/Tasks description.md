## connecting_points
Given 𝑛 points on a plane, connect them with segments of minimum total length such that there is a
path between any two points. Recall that the length of a segment with endpoints (𝑥1, 𝑦1) and (𝑥2, 𝑦2)
is equal to √︀(𝑥1 − 𝑥2)2 + (𝑦1 − 𝑦2)

## clustering
Given 𝑛 points on a plane and an integer 𝑘, compute the largest possible value of 𝑑 such that the
given points can be partitioned into 𝑘 non-empty subsets in such a way that the distance between any
two points from different subsets is at least 𝑑.
