## binary_search
The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.

## majority_problem
The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element.

## quick_sort_improved
To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with
few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new
partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < 𝑥 part, = 𝑥 part, and > 𝑥 part.

## inversions
The goal in this problem is to count the number of inversions of a given sequence.

## points_and_segments
You are given a set of points on a line and a set of segments on a line. The goal is to compute, for
each point, the number of segments that contain this point.

## closest_points
Given 𝑛 points on a plane, find the smallest distance between a pair of two (different) points. Recall
that the distance between points (𝑥1, 𝑦1) and (𝑥2, 𝑦2) is equal to √︀(𝑥1 − 𝑥2)^2 + (𝑦1 − 𝑦2)^2.
