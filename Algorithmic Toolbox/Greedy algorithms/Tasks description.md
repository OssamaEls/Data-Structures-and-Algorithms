## money_change
The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value
(an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

## fractional_knapsack
The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

## car_fueling
You are going to travel to another city that is located 𝑑 miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
at most 𝑚 miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1, stop2, . . . , stop𝑛 from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

## dot_product
Given two sequences 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛 (𝑎𝑖 is the profit per click of the 𝑖-th ad) and 𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑛 (𝑏𝑖 is
the average number of clicks per day of the 𝑖-th slot), we need to partition them into 𝑛 pairs (𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑗)
such that the sum of their products is maximized.

## covering_segments
Given a set of 𝑛 segments {[𝑎0, 𝑏0], [𝑎1, 𝑏1], . . . , [𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑏𝑛−1]} with integer coordinates on a line, find
the minimum number 𝑚 of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a
set of integers 𝑋 of the minimum size such that for any segment [𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖] there is a point 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 such
that 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏𝑖.

## different_summands
The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise
distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as
𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + · · · + 𝑎𝑘 where 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑘 are positive integers and 𝑎𝑖 ̸= 𝑎𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘.

## largest_number
