## two_sat
Solve the 2-SAT problem with the help of its implication graph.

## maximise_weight
Solve the maximum weighted independent set problem in trees.

## school_bus
Traveling Salesman Problem. Given a graph with weighted edges, you need to find the shortest cycle visiting each vertex exactly once. Vertices correspond to homes, the school and the depot. Edges weights correspond to the time to get from one
vertex to another one. Some vertices may not be connected by an edge in the general case.

## reschedule_exams
3-recoloring problem. You are given a graph, and each vertex is colored in one of the 3 possible colors. You need to assign another color to each vertex in such a way that no two vertices connected by and edge are assigned the same color. Here, possible colors correspond to the possible exam dates, vertices correspond to students, colors of the vertices correspond to the assignment of students to the exam dates, and edges correspond to the pairs of close friends.
### Solution idea: reduce this problem to a 2-SAT problem.
