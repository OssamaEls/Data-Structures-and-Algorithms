## evacuation
A tornado is approaching the city, and we need to evacuate the people quickly. There are several
roads outgoing from the city to the nearest cities and other roads going further. The goal is to evacuate
everybody from the city to the capital, as it is the only other city which is able to accomodate that
many newcomers. We need to evacuate everybody as fast as possible, and your task is to find out
what is the maximum number of people that can be evacuated each hour given the capacities of all
the roads.

## airline_crews
The airline offers a bunch of flights and has a set of crews that can work on those flights. However,
the flights are starting in different cities and at different times, so only some of the crews are able to
work on a particular flight. You are given the pairs of flights and associated crews that can work on
those flights. You need to assign crews to as many flights as possible and output all the assignments.
### Solution idea: maximum matching in bipartite graph.
